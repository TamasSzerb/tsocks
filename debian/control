Description: transparent network access through a SOCKS 4 or 5 proxy
 tsocks provides transparent network access through a SOCKS version 4
 or 5 proxy (usually on a firewall). tsocks intercepts the calls
 applications make to establish TCP connections and transparently
 proxies them as necessary. This allows existing applications to use
 SOCKS without recompilation or modification.
